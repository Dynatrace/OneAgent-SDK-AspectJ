This library is added in the directory and is only for running AspectJ within Eclipse. Since the Plugin does not work properly with the last version (Oxygen)
 there is a way to run/debug the application with AspectJ (Load Time Weaving) and Eclipse.
 
Click on Run > Run Configurations... add a new Java Application

Add the reference to the sample app in the Classpath:
Classpath > User Entries > add Project > select the aspect-ask-app project

Now add the following in the  Main tab
Project: aspect-sdk-agent
Main Class: de.dynatrace.sample.uriservice.Main

Arguments tab: client https://dynatrace.com -h:localhost -p:5050
VM Arguments:-javaagent:weaver\aspectjweaver-1.8.10.jar

That's it. Enjoy
